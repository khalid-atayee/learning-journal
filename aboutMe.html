                <p class="aboutMe-paragraph">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                    I've
                    made the big jump over to the
                    Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header margin-typo">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p class="aboutMe-paragraph margin-typo">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
            learning, then try to create
            simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
        <p class="aboutMe-paragraph margin-typo">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning
            and most things about my
            journey with the world.</p>

        <h2 class="margin-typo">How I got started</h2>

        <p class="aboutMe-paragraph margin-typo">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes
            about what I was learning.
            After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
            summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>

        <p class="aboutMe-paragraph margin-typo">
            That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
            others learn and stay motivated.</p>
